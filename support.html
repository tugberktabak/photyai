    <h2>1. Welcome to PhotyAi Support</h2>
    <p>Thank you for choosing PhotyAi! Our support team is dedicated to helping you with any issues or questions related to the App. Whether you’re facing technical difficulties, need assistance with credit purchases, or want to provide feedback, we’re here to assist.</p>

    <h2>2. How PhotyAi Works</h2>
    <p>PhotyAi allows you to upload a personal photograph and a model photograph to create a customized outfit image. The process uses Nano Banana API for image generation, with n8n managing the workflow. Your photos are not stored after generation. Credits (5, 20, or 50) are required for premium features and can be restored via the "Restore Purchase" option if needed.</p>

    <h2>3. Common Issues and Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Generation Failure</strong>: Ensure you have sufficient credits and a stable internet connection. Restart the App if the issue persists.</li>
        <li><strong>Credits Not Reflecting</strong>: Use the "Restore Purchase" feature to recover lost credits. Contact support if the problem continues.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Performance</strong>: Check your device storage and network speed. Clear the App cache if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Upload Errors</strong>: Verify that your photos meet the App’s format and size requirements (e.g., JPEG, under 10MB).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Contacting Support</h2>
    <p>For assistance, please email us at <a href="mailto:tugberktabak@yahoo.com">tugberktabak@yahoo.com</a>. Include your user ID (found in Settings), a description of the issue, and any screenshots to help us resolve it faster. We aim to respond within 48 hours.</p>

    <h2>5. Feature Requests and Feedback</h2>

    <h2>6. Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure your App is updated to the latest version from the App Store.</li>
        <li>Check your internet connection, as a weak signal may affect generation.</li>
        <li>If credits are depleted, purchase new packs (5, 20, or 50 credits) to continue using premium features.</li>
    </ul>
