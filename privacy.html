    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: September 23, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>PhotyAi collects only the data necessary to provide its services. When you use the App, you upload your own photograph and a model photograph to generate a styled image. We do not store these photos or any personal identifiable information (PII) after the generation process is complete. No user accounts or login credentials are required, and data is processed solely within the session.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage and Processing</h2>
    <p>Your uploaded photos are processed using Nano Banana API for image generation, with workflows managed through n8n. This process combines your photo with the model photo to create a customized outfit image. We ensure that all photos are deleted immediately after processing, and no copies are retained on our servers or third-party systems. The App uses a local identifier for credit management, which is stored on your device only.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>PhotyAi integrates with third-party services, including Nano Banana API for image generation, and n8n for workflow automation. These services may have their own privacy policies, but we contractually require them to delete any data received after processing. We do not share your photos or personal data with advertisers or other third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Credits and Purchase Data</h2>
    <p>Purchases of credits (available in 5, 20, or 50 packs) are handled through Apple’s In-App Purchase system. We do not collect or store your payment information, billing details, or purchase history. The "Restore Purchase" feature allows you to recover credits lost due to device changes, managed entirely by Apple’s infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data during the brief period it is processed. However, no online service is entirely immune to security risks. Your photos are not stored, reducing the risk of data breaches. If a security incident occurs, we will notify affected users promptly.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>As a user, you have the right to request information about data processing (though minimal in this case) and to discontinue use of the App at any time. Since we do not retain your photos, no data deletion request is necessary. For credit-related issues, use the "Restore Purchase" feature.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>PhotyAi is not intended for users under the age of 9. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn that a child’s data has been collected, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Notifications of significant updates will be provided within the App or via email. Continued use of PhotyAi after updates indicates your acceptance of the new policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>For privacy concerns, data inquiries, or to report a potential violation, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tugberktabak@yahoo.com">tugberktabak@yahoo.com</a>. Our team will address your request within 48 hours.</p>
